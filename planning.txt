What HTML element would you use for the search bar? 
-I think an Text Input

How about the drop down, the search button, and the filler text which will appear on the page?
-the dropdown could be a div that has text added to it as the text is added in the search bar.
-the search button can be another input with the button type.
-the filler text could be placeholder? or just prepopulate the search bar text input

What CSS would you use to create the color gradient on the page?
-body background color gradient

What type of JavaScript event listeners would you need to add to refresh the drop-down as a 
user types?
-The keyup event

How would you populate the search bar with an option from the drop down list? 
-You'd have to have an event listener that would take the event target's inner text and move 
that to the search bar.

What event would trigger this action?
-a click event

How would you structure your functions?
-I'll need a function which generates options in the dropdown menu as the user types.
This would be done by listening for a keyup event and then checking the value currently 
in the searchbar against the fruits provided in the starter code.
If I have an array for the fruits, maybe I can use a .filter() to get the values which match.

-I'll need a function which will populate the searchbar with the clicked value from the dropdown.
The click event.target.innerText can by used to set the searchbar
