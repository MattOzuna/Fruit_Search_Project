# Fruit Search Project

The goal of this project is to plan and build an Autofill Search Bar for various types of fruit. This small scale search bar suggests various fruits based on user input.

If a userâ€™s typed input is contained anywhere in one of the fruits in the list, then a drop down will appear containing all the fruits which match. As a user continues to add letters to their input, new dropdowns will populate. When a user clicks on one of these options, it will populate in the search bar.
